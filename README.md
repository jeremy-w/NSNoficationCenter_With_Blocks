This is the code accompanying the blog post
[NSNotificationCenter with blocks considered harmful][harm] by Drew Crawford.

I (@jeremy-w) forked this to post my solution to their challenge.
It's easy to solve if you're acquainted with two things:

- The standard weakâ€“strong dance to work around creating strong reference
  cycles in blocks
- The sharp corner of the queue-based notification API
  that the notification tokens do not unsubscribe themselves on `dealloc`.
  (WHY NOT?!)

Feel free to check out [my solution][solved].
